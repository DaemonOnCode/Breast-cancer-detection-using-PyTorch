# Breast-cancer-detection-using-PyTorch
Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in 
women and the second leading cause of cancer death in 
women after lung cancer.

India has witnessed 30% of the cases of breast cancer during 
the last few years and it is likely to increase. 
Breast cancer in India accounts that one woman is 
diagnosed every two minutes and every nine minutes, 
one woman dies. Early detection and diagnosis can 
save the lives of cancer patients.

My deep learning model uses PyTorch and a pre-defined 
dataset having 569 samples and 30 features each, 
which helps the model train with an accuracy of 97%
